# Deep Research

## Overview

Systematic multi-source research before acting on unknowns. Never guess when you can verify.
Plan your searches, execute in parallel where possible, synthesize before concluding.

## When to Use

- Starting work on an unfamiliar library, framework, or API
- Validating a technical approach before committing
- Answering questions that require current information
- Comparing options or evaluating trade-offs
- Verifying security practices or compatibility

## The Process

**1. Plan searches first**
Before searching, list the specific questions you need to answer.
Identify 3-5 targeted search queries that cover different angles.

**2. Execute searches in parallel**
Run multiple searches simultaneously where possible.
Prefer official documentation and primary sources over secondary.

**3. Evaluate source quality**
- Official docs > tutorials > blog posts > forums
- Recent (within 1-2 years) > older for fast-moving tech
- Multiple sources agreeing > single source

**4. Synthesize findings**
Reconcile conflicting information. Note gaps.
Present a clear answer with confidence level and key sources.

**5. Flag uncertainty**
If research is inconclusive, say so explicitly.
"I found X but couldn't verify Y — recommend checking Z."

## Research Quality Checklist

- [ ] Searched official documentation first
- [ ] Found at least 2 corroborating sources for key claims
- [ ] Checked publication dates for currency
- [ ] Noted any contradictions between sources
- [ ] Stated confidence level in findings

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I already know this" | Knowledge has a cutoff. Verify before acting. |
| "One source is enough" | Single sources miss context. Find corroboration. |
| "I'll research later" | Unknowns discovered mid-implementation cost more. Research first. |
| "The docs are probably right" | Docs lag implementation. Check issues/changelogs too. |

## Output Format

Present research as:
1. **Question answered**
2. **Finding** (the answer)
3. **Confidence** (high/medium/low)
4. **Sources** (URLs or doc sections)
5. **Caveats** (what you couldn't verify)
