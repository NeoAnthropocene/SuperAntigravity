# Using Liftoff

## Overview

You have liftoff installed. Before any action, check if a skill applies.
Skills are loaded automatically in Antigravity when the task matches the description.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing,
you ABSOLUTELY MUST let Antigravity load and read it.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Check for relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill
might apply means you let Antigravity load it. If a loaded skill turns out to be wrong
for the situation, you don't need to use it.

## Skill Priority

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, systematic-debugging) — HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (architecture-design, deep-research) — guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → systematic-debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (test-driven-development, systematic-debugging): Follow exactly.
**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP — you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Let Antigravity load current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Load it. |

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
