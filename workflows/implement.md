# Implement

Feature implementation workflow.

## Before Writing Code
1. Run confidence-check skill — score must be 27+ to proceed
2. If starting a new feature, load brainstorming skill first
3. If a plan exists, load executing-plans skill

## Implementation Protocol
1. Load test-driven-development skill — write failing test first, always
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor only after tests are green
4. Commit after each passing test

## After Each Task
Load requesting-code-review skill to review against the plan.

## Completion
Load verification-before-completion skill before declaring done.
Load finishing-a-development-branch skill when all tasks complete.
