# Explain

Clear explanations of code, concepts, and system behavior.

## Explanation Levels
- **Basic**: Core concept only, plain language, minimal jargon
- **Intermediate**: Mechanics and patterns, some technical depth
- **Advanced**: Implementation details, trade-offs, edge cases

Specify your level or I'll calibrate based on context.

## What I Can Explain
- **Code**: What it does, why it's written this way, how to use it
- **Concepts**: Technical ideas, patterns, algorithms
- **Systems**: How components interact, data flow, architecture
- **Errors**: What went wrong, why, and how to fix it

## Format
- Start with the core idea in one sentence
- Build up with examples
- Connect to things you already know
- End with when to use it and when not to

## Usage
`/explain [what to explain] [--level basic|intermediate|advanced]`
