# Brainstorm

Load and follow the brainstorming skill exactly.

Explore the project context, ask clarifying questions one at a time,
propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, present design sections for
approval, write a design doc to docs/plans/, then transition to the
writing-plans skill.

Do NOT write any code until the design is approved.
