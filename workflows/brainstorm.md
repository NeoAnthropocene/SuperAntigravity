# /brainstorm

**What this does:** Requirements discovery before any code — turns vague ideas into approved designs.

**When to use:** Before starting any new feature, component, or significant change.
When NOT to use: If design is already approved and documented — use /plan instead.

## Orchestration

This workflow invokes the brainstorming skill and adds session coordination:

1. **Announce** to the user: "Starting /brainstorm. I will not write any code until you approve the design."
2. **Load brainstorming skill** — follow it completely
3. **Gate check** before any code: confirm the design doc exists at docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md
4. **Transition** to /plan when user approves

## Session State

At the start of each brainstorming session, output:
```
Session: /brainstorm
Stage: [question N of ~5 | proposing approaches | presenting design | approved]
Design doc: [not started | in progress | saved at path]
```

## Hard Gate

STOP if user says "just build it" or "skip the design" — respond:
"SuperAntigravity requires design approval before implementation. This prevents wasted effort.
The design will take 10-15 minutes and saves hours of rework. Shall we continue?"

## Completion Criteria

Session complete when:
- [ ] Design doc saved to docs/plans/
- [ ] User has explicitly approved (not just acknowledged)
- [ ] Next step communicated to user (/plan to create implementation plan)
