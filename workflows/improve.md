# Improve

Apply systematic improvements to code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Improvement Categories

### Code Quality
- Extract duplicated logic into reusable functions
- Simplify complex conditionals
- Improve naming for clarity
- Reduce function/method length

### Performance
Load performance-optimization skill — measure before improving.

### Security
Load security-review skill — check for vulnerabilities.

### Maintainability
- Add missing error handling at system boundaries
- Improve test coverage for critical paths
- Simplify over-engineered abstractions
- Document non-obvious decisions

## Rules
- Measure before improving performance
- Test before and after any refactoring
- One improvement at a time — commit between each
- YAGNI — don't add abstractions for hypothetical future needs
- Load verification-before-completion before declaring improved
