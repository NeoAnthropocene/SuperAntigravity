# Plan

Load and follow the writing-plans skill exactly.

Write a comprehensive implementation plan with bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each).
Every task must include exact file paths, complete code, exact commands with expected output.

Save the plan to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md

After saving, offer two execution options:
1. Subagent-Driven (this session) — fresh subagent per task with review
2. Parallel Session (separate) — open new session with executing-plans skill
