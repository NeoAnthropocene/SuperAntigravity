# Test

Run tests with coverage analysis.

Load test-driven-development skill for the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR process.

## Running Tests
1. Run full test suite first to establish baseline
2. Report: total tests, passed, failed, skipped, coverage %
3. For failures: show exact error messages, not summaries

## On Test Failure
Load systematic-debugging skill — investigate root cause before fixing.
Load verification-before-completion skill before declaring tests fixed.

## Coverage
- Report overall coverage %
- Flag files below 80% coverage
- Do NOT write tests purely to increase coverage numbers

## Before Declaring Done
Load verification-before-completion skill.
Actually run the tests. Do not claim they pass without running them.
